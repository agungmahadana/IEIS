# IEIS (Image Emotion Identification System)

![IEIS Screen Shot](images/readme.jpeg)

Image Emotion Identification System [(IEIS)](https://agungmahadana-ieis-home-odfm5c.streamlit.app/) is a web-based application that can analyze the sentiment of the image. This app utilizes the GLCM method for texture analysis, and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify the image's sentiment with more than 2,000 dataset. It is important to note that the uploaded images should have a resolution of 48x48 pixels, a 1:1 aspect ratio and be properly aligned with the face.

Use the `README.md` to get started.
